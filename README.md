# Advent of Code 2022

(WIP) My solution to Advent of Code 2022 in python.


This repo use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as the package manager. To install dependency, run
`poetry update`.
Also, I use `aoc_helper` for fetching puzzle inputs. Currently I have no plan to use the data structures that it provides.


The `Justfile` contains several handy commands for development, including running the test.
